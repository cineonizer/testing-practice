# Testing Practice

This is the [Testing Practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice) project from the curriculum of [The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

#### What is The Odin Project?

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) is a free open-source coding curriculum that helps students learn the necessary skills to become full stack developers from scratch. The curriculum is self-paced and makes use of online resources, such as tutorials, blogs, videos, and official documentation. Students learn from lessons and modules and build portfolio-worthy projects to master their skills in web development.
